GAIA : Generative AI for Automated Assessment in Education (AWS Cloud Deployment)

Project Overview

GAIA is a cloud-based AI application that automates grading and feedback for student assignments. The platform streamlines assessment by enabling teachers to upload assignments and rubrics; students can submit answers and receive instant, personalized feedback. Using generative AI, GAIA improves grading speed, accuracy, and fairness—all hosted-on AWS for scalability and reliability.

Project Objective

•	Build a demo-ready web system to automate grading and feedback using AI
•	Reduce grading workload and turnaround time for teachers
•	Provide consistent, unbiased feedback to students
•	Deliver analytics dashboards for educators

Motivation

This project is motivated by the need to address educator workload, delayed feedback cycles, and biases in assessment. By integrating generative AI, GAIA promotes equitable, efficient, and data-driven educational processes.

Conclusion

GAIA demonstrates the practical value of combining generative AI and cloud services to modernize educational assessment. The project delivers an MVP hosted on AWS within a month, focusing on core features and future scalability.
